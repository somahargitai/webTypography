It is my knowledge base on typography, focusing on web typography.

## Coding environment

I use Visual Studio Code. The following extensions are highly recommended:
- Live Server
- Live Sass Compiler
- Prettier
- HTML Boilerplate (or something similar)
- eslint

I also like these ones:
- Bracket Pair Coloriyer 2
- Git Blame
- Git Lens
- Git Stash

You will also need NodeJS, npm, Git

All the folders have their README files, describing necessary utilities. They include IBM Plex Sans Roman font, Lettering JS, Splitting JS, SASS
